## Introduction

This is a report on 2010 gun murder rate obtained from FBI reports. The original data was obtained from here (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gun_violence_in_the_United_States).

We are to use the following library:

```{r loading-libs, message=FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
```
and load the data we already wrangled:

```{r}
load('rda/murders.rda')
```

## Murders rate by state
We note the large state to state variability by generating a barplot showing the murder rate by state:

```{r murder-rate-by-state, echo=FALSE}
murders%>%mutate(abb=reorder(abb,rate))%>%
  ggplot(aes(abb,rate))+
  geom_bar(width=0.5,stat="identity",colour="black")+
  coord_flip()+
  theme_dark()
```
